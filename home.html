                <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The underlying purpose of our project is to provide an educational tool for the UNC economics department, specifically the quantitative financial economics program (QFE). At the present moment, there are python libraries (Pyfolio in particular) that provide the capacity to form and track portfolios over time. However, these libraries don&rsquo;t provide the ability to backtest in the sense that, knowing the past performance of an investable universe, you can optimize the weights of a set of assets within a portfolio over a period of time and compare with other portfolios. They also lack any form of intuitive user interface, and are designed primarily for algorithmic trading. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an educational perspective, the optimal set of weights changes over time, which in turn can be related to topics of interest for the QFE program. Particularly, this will related to the behavior of financial markets and portfolio optimization. In addition, our project will have an extensive visualization component, given there are many ways to present statistics related to portfolio performance and of use in an educational environment. Ultimately, our application aims to provide an intuitive user interface as well as extend upon the Pyfolio library (though not necessarily using the library itself) with the above functionality. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as platform goes, our application will be exclusively web-based and will be hosted on Carolina Cloud Applications through the economics department account. It will also link from the QFE wordpress site. Data for the project will be sourced from Quandl, particularly the EOD (end-of-day) US equity database. Funding for this subscription is provided by the QFE program. </span></p>
